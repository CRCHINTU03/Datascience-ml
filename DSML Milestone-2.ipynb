    "On January 30, 2020, and March 11, 2020, respectively, the World Health Organization (WHO) formally declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. WHO recommended nations to use stringent social segregation and quarantine measures to protect public from the virus spread. Covid-19 has severely affected the lives of people around the world it is like the world has been stopped for like a short period due to the lockdown and rise of covid cases around the various places on this planet. Here in this project, we can able to see how many humans were affected with covid 19 virus and perform analysis to check how males are affected, and the females. We plot the analysis charts for the cases recorded and try to get a sense of the outcome like which section of people are affected worse and their patterns for the spread of the covid-19. Along with we are trying to find what is the number of people reported to have been admitted and among which are trying to segregate(divide) into different categories and get an understanding of how hospitalization affects people’s health conditions. By finding these results, we can predict and analyse how a pandemic affects the world's health condition and population.\n",

The datasets provide current information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccination rates, hospitalizations, and more. The dataset we have considered has around 40 variables with 1175382 rows.\n",
