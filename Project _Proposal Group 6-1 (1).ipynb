Some cases of the common cold in humans (which is also brought on by other viruses, primarily rhinoviruses), while more deadly types can bring about SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, which is driving the ongoing pandemic. They cause diarrhea in pigs and cows and hepatitis and encephalomyelitis in mice.</p><p>\n",

We can observe the survival rate of younger women is higher compared to other groups and it also shows patients with a median age of 61 who are male have died within 14 days.</li><li>\n",
    "Weather Conditions and COVID-19 Incidence in a Cold Climate: A Time-Series Study in Finland in this paper we have got to know whether climate plays any role in the covid-19 infection spreading rate. For they have collected the covid-19 daily counts for 3 months from Dec 31 to May 31 2020 across the nation around all districts and the metrological department has measured the air quality from the nearby stations. The outcome obtained from the result we have concluded that there might not be any strong evidence that climate may increase the covid-19 spread but as the data is limited and there are few expectations thus they could not come to a conclusion if the weather spreads covid-19  </li>\n",
